# Quantum Painter display only

![Amazing!](images/GC9A01.png "Amazing!")

When I first started looking into Quantum Painter, I tried to find a simple example on how to get it up and running.

I'm not a complete hardware n00b, but while the documentation for Quantum Painter is well written and extensive, I still
found it hard to put all the pieces together. Understanding the rp2040 pin configuration, the SPI protocol, how Quantum
Painter worked, and so on and then stitching it all together was not obvious to me.

After getting some help in the QMK discord, I managed to get my first display working - A two inch 320x240 LCD using the
ST7789 driver. After getting the basics up and running, I decided to create a simple display only keyboard that can be
used to test different LCD's and get a basic idea what is needed to get Quantum Painter up and running.

Also, I wanted a configuration the would be widely compatible with almost _any_ Elite Pi/RP2040 based keyboard, making
it possible to add a color LCD using Quantum Painter to an existing keyboard.

### So here it is - **The Guide** I wish I would have found when I started looking into Quantum Painter.

Let's start by going over some nomenclature.

* **QMK** - The keyboard firmware
* **Quantum** Painter - The feature in QMK that makes it possible to easily show graphics on different LCD's.
* **Controller** - The hardware that QMK runs on. Only RP2040 based controllers can use Quantum Painter. Pro Micro
  controllers won't work.
* **SPI** - The protocol used to communicate between the controller and the display.

One of the things I found it hard to wrap my head around was which pins that could/had to be used on the controller. I
wanted to use the "Extra" pins on the bottom of the controller (12,13,14,15 and 16) since these are rarely used and
would make it _a lot_ easier to add a display to more or less any keyboard. While possible to use other pin
configurations on the rp2040, the configuration we will use on this keyboard will utilize the extra pins.

Elite Pi compatible controllers (I use the Liatris from SplitKB, but any Elite Pi compatible controller
should work) have two SPI channels, SPID0 and SPID1. These two different channels have a bunch of different possible
configurations, but only SPID1 can be used on the extra pins.

If you look at the image above, you can follow the teal labels for SPI. Please note that what is called DX, eg. D1-D29
on the image above, is called GP1-GP29 in QMK. Also, do not mistake the orange I2C labels with the SPI ones - they are
not the same protocol.

### To connect an LCD display to the RP2040 over SPI, you need to connect seven pins:

![2" st7789 display, 320x240](images/st7789.png "2\" st7789 display, 320x240" )

* GND -> Ground
* VCC -> VCC
* SCL -> SCK1 (Clock)
* SDA -> TX1 (Data/MOSI)
* RST -> Any available pin on the RP2040
* CS -> Any available pin on the RP2040
* DC -> Any available pin on the RP2040

As mentioned, there is two SPI channels on the RP2040, SPID0 and SPID1.
The only pins that _must_ be connected to specific pins is VCC, GND, SCL, and SDA. All other pins can be connected to
any unused pin on the RP2040, as long as they are properly configured in QMK.

So, valid configurations for SPI channel 0 (SPID0) would be:

* Any of the pins D2, D6, D10, D22 for SCL/SCK.
* Any of the pins D11, D3, D7, D23 for SDA/TX/MOSI
* RST, CS and DC can be connected to any unused pin

Valid configurations for SPI channel 1 (SPID1) would be:

* Any of the pins D14, D26 for SCL/SCK.
* Any of the pins D15, D27 for SDA/TX/MOSI
* RST, CS and DC can be connected to any unused pin

Several SPI devices can be connected to the same channel as long as the CS (Chip select) pin is separate for the
different devices.
So, while the first device will require five pins, any additional device will only require one more unused pin and can
share the rest with the other devices on the same channel.
I won't go through connecting several SPI devices on the same channel in this guide, but it can be good to know that
it's possible.

### Enough talk. How to get going?

This firmware uses the extra pins on the bottom of the controller, pins 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16. You will also need to
wire up VCC and GND (available as pads on most PCB's, otherwise they can be wired directly to the controller)

I've built two _ready to go_ keyboard configurations. One for a 2" 320x240 st7789 display, and the round GC9A01 1.28"
240x240
display.

To build these, run

_make qp_display_only:default_ to build the st7789 firmware,

and

_make qp_display_only:gc9a01_ for the GC9A01 firmware.

This keyboard is intentionally created as simple as possible in order to make it easy to add Quantum painter to your own
keyboard.

### Some important notes:

* In config.h, you can set SPI_MODE. There is four modes, 0,1,2,3. The documentation for your display _should_ describe
  what mode you need to use. However, if you don't get any output on your screen, you can just try the different modes
  by changing the SPI_MODE in config.h to any of these four modes and reflash your controller.
* If the colors are inverted, set _#define LCD_INVERT_COLOR_ in config.h.
* If you still don't have any image on your screen, try playing around with the LCD_SPI_DIVISOR value. Try to set it to
  a higher value, like 32.
* If you have a display with a different resolution, set LCD_WIDTH and LCD_HEIGHT in config.h. For this keyboard, they
  are set in the keymap/config.h

### Ok, so I got this firmware working for my display, how do I move it over to my keyboard?

* Copy _halconf.h_ to your keyboard firmware
* Add these fields to config.h:
    * #define SPI_DRIVER SPID1
    * #define SPI_SCK_PIN GP14
    * #define SPI_MOSI_PIN GP15
    * #define SPI_MISO_PIN GP20 // Unused
    * #define LCD_RST_PIN GP16
    * #define LCD_DC_PIN GP12
    * #define LCD_CS_PIN GP13
    * #define LCD_BLK_PIN GP7 // Unused in this configuration
    * #define LCD_SPI_DIVISOR 4
    * #define LCD_WAIT_TIME 150
    * #define LCD_ROTATION QP_ROTATION_0
    * #define LCD_OFFSET_X 0
    * #define LCD_OFFSET_Y 0
    * #define LCD_WIDTH 320 // Set according to your display specs
    * #define LCD_HEIGHT 240 // Set according to your display specs
    * #define SPI_MODE 2 // Set according to your display specs
    * #define ST7789 // Set according to your display specs
    * #define QUANTUM_PAINTER_SUPPORTS_NATIVE_COLORS TRUE
    * // Timeout configuration, default 30000 (30 sek). 0 = No timeout. Beware of image retention.
    * #define QUANTUM_PAINTER_DISPLAY_TIMEOUT 0
* Copy the gfx folder to your keyboard firmware
* Add the code from _qp_display_only.c_ to _keyboard_post_init_kb_ in your firmware.

### Thanks to :)

I would never had been able to sort this without the help of **tzarc**, **elpekenin** and **honorless** on the QMK
Discord (link below)
